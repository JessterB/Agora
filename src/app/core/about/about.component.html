            Agora hosts evidence for whether or not genes are associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). Agora also contains a list
            of over 500 nascent drug targets for AD that were nominated by AD researchers. The list of nominated targets was contributed
            by researchers from the National Institute on Aging&#39;s <a class="link" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/amp-ad" target="_blank">Accelerating Medicines
            Partnership in Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (AMP-AD) consortium</a> as well as other <span class="link" (click)="getNavService().goToRouteRelative('/teams-contributing')">research
            teams</span>. Other evidence presented in Agora was either generated by AMP-AD research teams or is aggregated from publicly available data sources.
