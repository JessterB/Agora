            Agora hosts evidence for whether or not genes are associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Agora also contains a list
            of close to one hundred nascent drug targets for AD that were nominated by AD researchers. The initial list of
            nominated targets was contributed by researchers from the National Institute on Aging’s Accelerating Medicines
            Partnership in Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD) consortium. Other evidence presented in Agora was either generated by
            AMP-AD research teams or is aggregated from publicly available data sources. Future versions of Agora will incorporate
            other types of -omics evidence as well as target nominations from additional AD research groups. Please include the
            following acknowledgement statement in any publications stemming from data in Agora: <i>The results published here are in
            whole or in part based on data obtained from Agora, a platform that shares evidence in support of AD target discovery
            initially developed by the NIA-funded AMP-AD consortium.</i>
