                &nbsp;Targets have been scored for likely suitability for small-molecule drugs (SM ligandability) in a multi-step process. In brief, targets are placed into buckets that are ordered according to preference for small-molecule (SM) drug development, with smaller bucket numbers being generally accepted as easier or more likely to result in successful drug development than larger numbered buckets.
