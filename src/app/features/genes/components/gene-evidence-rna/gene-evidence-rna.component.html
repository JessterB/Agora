        The box plot depicts how the differential expression of the selected
        gene of interest (red dot) compares with expression of other genes in a

        The network diagram below is based on a coexpression network analysis of
        RNA-seq data from AD cases and controls. The network analysis uses an
        ensemble methodology to identify genes that show similar coexpression
        across individuals.

        The color of the edges and nodes indicates how frequently significant
        coexpression was identified. Each node represents a different gene and
        the amount of edges within the network. Darker edges represent
        coexpression in more brain regions.
