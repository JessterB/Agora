        Agora provides users the ability to discover and explore evidence linking genes and
        networks to Alzheimer's disease. Agora presents analyses derived from DNA and RNA
        sequencing, genotyping, proteomic, and metabolomic data from human cohorts and model
        system experiments from the AMP-AD, M2OVE-AD, MODEL-AD, and Resilience-AD consortia.
        Users can search evidence for any gene of interest and can view putative Alzheimerâ€™s
        disease targets nominated by consortia researchers.

    <p class="black-paragraph">
        AMP-AD teams nominate gene targets using analytical methods that integrate molecular
        data generated by the consortia. Each nominated target represents a gene with evidence
        for potential influences on Alzheimer disease etiology.
